# How to Test/Set up the Project
  The first thing required to set and test this project is to download the Python Language. I personally made this project in Python 3.9.1 but any Python 3 version should be       fine. I haven't tested it in Python 2 so no promises there. You can download and install Python from the link posted below.
  
      https://www.python.org/downloads/
      
  Once downloaded, you should be able to check if it installed correctly by navigating to a terminal or Command Prompt and typing in:
  
      >python
  
  Once Python is installed, you have finished the first step.

  Next you will need to installed a Python IDE. There are many like, but this one is mine. I have used to create this Project the IDE Pycharm. Which can be downloaded from the       link below:
  
      https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
      
  Of course, there should be no problem making changes to the code with other IDE, this was just the one I am familiar with. If you wanna use NotePad, more power to you.
  
  
  Next though, to run the Game, you will need to install a python framework called Pygame. The easiest way to install it is using a pip command, like the one listed below:
 
      py -m pip install -U pygame --user
      
  But, if you have youre own seperate environment or can install extensions like this through your IDE, usually a way to download them can be found in the settings. For example,   in Pycharm it can be found by going to: 
  
      File->Settings->Project:(InsertYourProjectNameHere)->Python Interpreter-> + Button and then searching for Pygame
      
  Once both Python and Pygame are installed are you should be able to test if the project is working by simply double clicking the .py file, which will start an instance of the   game on you computer. Using the Arrows and SpaceBar, you should be able to play the game. Once you die, the game should exit out. If your experience is similiar, then the two   mentioned above are installed correctly. After that, you should be able to open the project in some IDE and contribute to the code how you see fit.

# How To Contribute

  If you would like to contribute to this project, the Easiest way would be to choose one of the issues listed and take it on. To do this, simply create a personal fork of the     project. Then, following the sets above, setup the working and testing environment and test the project to see if it is working properly. Once that is complete, you may make     all the changes you see fit that will complete the issue you have chosen to take on. Once you feel the new feature you have added is complete, and is working properly, you may   make a Pull Request, upon which I will review you code and accept it into the game.
  
  The only conditions I have about changes to the game are as follows: DONT BREAK IT. Any requests made with not functionally code will not be accepted. Any bugs that occur due   to code you contribute are subject to removal without notice. I understand not every piece of code is perfect and some problems might be very specific or only occur for very     specific conditions. These are not the type of errors I am talking about, I will try to be more understadning about Unforseen Consequences in the code you contribute. Any       other changes to the UI, Gameplay, Game State, are all fair game are far as changes go.
